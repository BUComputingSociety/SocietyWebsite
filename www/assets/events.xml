        <title>RoboCode</title>
        <content>The first in our series of RoboCode tournaments. We introduced new students to the RoboCode API and let them build their own simple robots. At the end of the night we did a single-elimination tournament. RassBerry was our winning bot but the Prize was given to our highest ranking First Year, ChromaZone.</content>

        <title>Society Website</title>
        <content>Our first project as a society was to build our own website. First years worked on the core html sections of the website, while more experienced members worked on the fancy features. This project gave every member the opportunity to use Git a useful tool that isn't taught at the University.</content>
