    <p>The <b><i>BU Computing Society</i></b> was founded in October 2017.</p>
    <p>Our aims are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide members with opportunities to practice and develop their computing skills in a more casual way.</li>
        <li>Appeal to students of all pathways on the computing course.</li>
        <li>Appeal to non-computing students.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do this through working on projects, running RoboCode competitions and mini hackathons.</p>
